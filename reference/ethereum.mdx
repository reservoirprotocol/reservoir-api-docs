# Understanding Ethereum

Ethereum, a pioneering blockchain platform, provides a robust infrastructure for Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT) marketplaces, setting itself apart from other blockchains through its unique features. Its groundbreaking functionalities, such as Smart Contracts, the ERC-721 standard, decentralization, and large-scale adoption, have shaped the thriving NFT landscape.

## Ethereum Blockchain Features

1. **Smart Contracts:** At the heart of Ethereum are smart contracts - self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into lines of code. These allow for secure and trustless transactions, making it perfect for conducting trades on NFT marketplaces.
2. **ERC-721 Standard:** Ethereum introduced a standard for NFTs known as ERC-721. This standard ensures that each token is unique, distinguishing Ethereum from other blockchains and making it ideal for minting and trading NFTs.
3. **Decentralization:** Ethereum's decentralized nature makes it immune to censorship and gives it resilience to attempts of control. This appeals to artists and creators who wish to have total ownership of their work.
4. **Large-scale Adoption:** As one of the first widely adopted blockchains, Ethereum is the backbone of many NFT transactions.
