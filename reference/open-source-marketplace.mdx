In addition to the configuration above we've also added comments prefixed with `CONFIGURABLE:` throughout the app pointing out some pieces of code where you could customize functionality. After cloning the app make sure to search the repo for the aforementioned prefix.

### Deeplinking to Actions

The open source marketplace supports deeplinking to purchase actions. Deeplinking to these pages require the user to log in and if they are not on the right chain, chain switching will be prompted if necessary. Note that deeplinking to minting only works if the collection is actively minting. Below are the list of actions and how to deeplink to them:

| Action    | Url Sample                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
