## React Hooks

React hooks let you use state and other React features without writing classes. ReservoirKit provides hooks for actions like getting tokens from a collection (useTokens), getting collection activity (getCollectionActivity) and many more. Learn more about the ReservoirKit hooks [here](/reference/reservoirkit-hooks).

## Modals

ReservoirKit provides modals for common market actions that are simple to configure. You can configure the modals and use them out of the box, or customize them. Since the modals are headless, they are fully customizable. There are models for buying tokens, adding tokens to a cart, and many more here.
