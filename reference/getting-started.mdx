Reservoir's developer tools are a modular set of tools that allows you to interact with the NFT ecosystem at the appropriate level of abstraction for your application. The basic components of the toolkit are:

# [NFT Trading & Data APIs](/reference/overview)

Reservoir APIs provide all-in-one endpoints for building NFT applications. The NFT trading APIs allow you to trade NFTs across major NFT marketplaces and create your own order book with advanced order types and custom fees. The NFT data APIs provide granular token price data, real-time collection floor price and top bid events, token and collection metadata, and more. The API is wrapped in an easy-to-use [TS/JS SDK](/reference/reservoir-sdk-jstsnode) with performant methods.

# [NFT Websockets](/reference/websockets)

The Reservoir websocket service allows developers to establish a connection and obtain real-time event updates, eliminating the requirement for constant polling. You can subscribe to events, and optionally provide a filter object to narrow down events based on specific tags.

# [Reservoir SDK](/reference/reservoir-sdk-jstsnode)

Reservoir SDK is the underlying package that ReservoirKit UI uses behind the scenes to execute core functionality (listing, bidding, buying and selling). The Reservoir SDK can be used if you are using another JavaScript framework, executing orders via a Nodejs server or building a custom experience.

# [ReservoirKit](/reference/reservoirkit)

ReservoirKit is a React library that makes it easy to add marketplace functionality to your project. The kit has out-of-the-box and customizable (headless) modals for major market actions, as well as a series of useful hooks to simplify development.

# [Open-source Marketplace](/reference/open-source-marketplace)

Reservoir's open-source marketplace is a NextJS app that you can fork and use freely as a stand-alone marketplace or a base for building something more custom and unique. You can check out our fully-functional reference deployment [here](https://marketplace.reservoir.tools/).
