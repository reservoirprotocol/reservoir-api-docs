MintModal provides an easy way to mint one or multiple tokens from various contracts.

# Prerequisites ⚙️

[Install and configure ReservoirKit](/reference/installing-reservoirkit).

# MintModal Setup

ReservoirKit provides a simple to configure modal for adding minting to your react app. Below is an example of a simple MintModal setup.

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript typescript
  import { MintModal } from '@reservoir0x/reservoir-kit-ui'

  <MintModal
    trigger={
        <button>
        	Mint
        </button>
      }
  	onConnectWallet={onConnectWallet}
    contract="0xf5de760f2e916647fd766b4ad9e85ff943ce3a2b"
    onMintComplete={(data) => {
      console.log('Mint Complete', data)
    }}
    onMintError={(error, data) => {
      console.log('Mint Error', error, data)
    }}
    onClose={(data, currentStep) => {
      console.log('MintModal Closed')
    }}
  />
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Let's dive into the parameters:

| **openState**       | This is a state tuple from react's [useState](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html), you can use this to programmatically open or close the modal. The modal will use this state when determining if the modal is open or closed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | N        |
| **copyOverrides**   | An object containing copy overrides for titles and ctas contained in the modal. Refer to the `ModalCopy` [type](https://github.com/reservoirprotocol/reservoir-kit/blob/main/packages/ui/src/modal/mint/MintModal.tsx#L54) for which tokens map to what copy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | N        |
| **feesOnTopBps**    | Used to conditionally apply a referral fee on top of an order when purchasing. The parameter is an array of strings with the referrer and the fee separated by a colon: `['0xabc:250']`. The fee is in bps. The fee currency will follow the default rules for the execute buy endpoint `feesOnTop` parameter. This takes precedence over the `feesOnTopFixed`.                                                                                                                                                           | N        |
| **feesOnTopUsd**    | Used to conditionally apply a referral fee on top of an order when purchasing. The parameter is an array of strings with the referrer and the fee separated by a colon: `['0xabc:1000000']`. The fee is a flat fee in the atomic unit of usd (6 decimals). It will then be converted to the purchase currency to match the same value in USD. So for example if you have 1000000 configured (1 usd) and the total price is in ETH the fee applied will be \~0.00054 ETH (or whatever is equivalent to 1 usd in realtime). | N        |
| **chainId**         | The chain id to force the modal to render, ensure that this is a chain that is configured in the ReservoirKit provider. If not specified then the active chain configured in the ReservoirKitProvider will be used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | N        |

## Custom MintModal

The MintModal also comes with a custom renderer which can be used to just get the data layer that the MintModal uses internally to handle the underlying business logic. With the renderer you can rebuild the UI completely to your liking. Below is an example of how it works in practice.

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript typescript
  import { MintModal, MintStep } from '@reservoir0x/reservoir-kit-ui'

  <MintModal.Custom
    open={open}
    contract={contract}>
    {({
       loading,
       isFetchingPath,
       collection,
       token: tokenData,
       orders,
       totalIncludingFees,
       feeOnTop,
       feeUsd,
       paymentTokens,
       paymentCurrency,
       setPaymentCurrency,
       addFundsLink,
       chainCurrency,
       itemAmount,
       setItemAmount,
       maxItemAmount,
       setMaxItemAmount,
       usdPrice,
       usdPriceRaw,
       currentChain,
       address,
       isConnected,
       disableJumperLink,
       balance,
       hasEnoughCurrency,
       transactionError,
       fetchMintPathError,
       stepData,
       mintStep,
       setStepData,
       setMintStep,
       mintTokens,
    }) => {
      { Your Custom React Elements }
    })}
  </MintModal.Custom>
  ```
</CodeGroup>

The custom MintModal takes a few parameters like before with one additional one being the `open` parameter. This is because there is no trigger, you have control over what sort of modal you want this to eventually live in and how to trigger that modal. You'll have the ability to add a custom button with a custom handler, etc. The custom MintModal then passes some key data into the children which we parse above and use in our custom UI. It's also important to note the `MintStep` here which is used to manage the internal state of the MintModal's logic. You can decide to use all or some of the data passed into your custom implementation.
