When using Reservoir for your infrastructure, out of the box you'll get distribution and aggregation immediately onto your platform. Explore where orders are natively distributed just by using Reservoir, or see where we pull orders from across the NFT ecosystem.

# Distribution

Building with Reservoir will automatically distribute your orders to these high volume platforms. Your platform will also have access to all orders created on the marketplaces below and more.
