# Getting Started with Market on Reservoir

Reservoir offers access to [150+ marketplaces](/reference/supported-marketplaces) through our simple, and powerful APIs, SDKs & UI kits. You can find a list of supported marketplaces, [here](/reference/supported-marketplaces). To access data or trading for one of these marketplaces get started with an [API key](/reference/dashboard-sign-up) which has a generous [free plan & affordable paid subscriptions](https://reservoir.tools/pricing). All Reservoir endpoints include orders from all of our supported marketplaces. Should you want to access a specific market's data and trading specifically, you can. However, Reservoir doesn't support posting orders to all marketplaces. The following sections outline how to access a specific marketplace's data and trading using Reservoir.

# Getting Market Data & Orders

* **Sales** - Get Sales from our [Sales API](/reference/getsalesv5). Filtering using the API is not currently supported, so get all sales for a token, collection, or attribute, and filter on the front end using `"orderSource": "MARKETPLACE_DOMAIN"`or `"fillSource": "MARKETPLACE_DOMAIN"`. When using `orderSource` you are filtering by sales whose orders are native to that marketplace, while filtering on `fillSource` will return all sales that were filled on that marketplace, regardless of the order origination marketplace.
* **Asks (Listings)** - Asks (listings) can be accessed through our [Asks API.](/reference/getordersasksv4) To get listings, ensure to set the `source=MARKETPLACE_DOMAIN`. [An example of the response.](https://api.reservoir.tools/orders/asks/v4?source=opensea.io)
* **Bids (Offers)** - Bids (offers) can be accessed through our [Bids API.](/reference/getordersbidsv5) To get offers, ensure to set the `source=MARKETPLACE_DOMAIN`. [An example of the response.](https://api.reservoir.tools/orders/bids/v5?source=opensea.io)
