# Understanding BSC

Binance initially developed the Binance Chain, which had limitations in programmability. To address these limitations, they introduced the Binance Smart Chain (BSC), specifically designed for smart contract-based applications. BSC operates alongside the native Binance Chain, enabling users to leverage high transaction capacity. Additionally, BSC incorporated the Ethereum Virtual Machine, allowing it to run Ethereum-based applications. The primary objective of BSC was to facilitate the development of decentralized applications (DApps) and aid users in efficiently managing their digital assets across chains. BSC was subsequently rebranded as the BNB chain, marking a significant evolution in its journey.
