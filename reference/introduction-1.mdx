## Available Data

In the current Alpha release, you can get the collection floor price for any NFT contract on Ethereum, with the following options:

**Methodology**: Spot, 24hr TWAP, Upper (`max(Spot,TWAP)`) or Lower (`min(Spot,TWAP)`) **Currency**: ETH, WETH or USDC

## Modes

The Oracle supports two modes, depending on the type of data that you need:

**On-Demand** > Bring floor prices for ANY collection on-chain when users take actions **Feeds** > Access regularly published floor data for the most popular NFT collections

Each mode has a different usage flow, which are outlined below:

## On-Demand

In most-cases, we recommend using On-Demand oracle updates. These have the following advantages:

* Flexibility to support any NFT collection, pricing methodology or currency
* Get fresh updates whenever users take actions

On-demand updates effectively “piggyback” user transactions, with the following flow:

* User takes an action in a Dapp
* Dapp requests a price update from the [Oracle API](/reference/getoraclecollectionsflooraskv5) in the background
* Dapp builds the users’ transaction, including the signed Oracle update
* User signs and submits the transaction
* Contract validates the Oracle update, and processes user transaction

The [signed message format](https://github.com/reservoirprotocol/oracle/blob/main/contracts/ReservoirOracle.sol) is based on [TrustUs](https://github.com/ZeframLou/trustus), with some minor modifications.

## Examples

The following examples are available:

[RelativeFloorBids.sol](https://github.com/reservoirprotocol/oracle/blob/main/contracts/examples/RelativeFloorBids.sol) Create collection-wide bids with dynamic pricing relative to the collection floor

[PriceDataRecorder.sol](https://github.com/reservoirprotocol/oracle/blob/main/contracts/examples/PriceDataRecorder.sol) Simple example that saves the results of on-demand oracle updates

[PriceDataRecorderEIP3668.sol](https://github.com/reservoirprotocol/oracle/blob/main/contracts/examples/PriceDataRecorderEIP3668.sol) Same as above, using the [EIP3668: Secure offchain data retrieval](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3668) standard

[DataFeedOracleAdaptor.sol](https://github.com/reservoirprotocol/oracle/blob/main/contracts/examples/DataFeedOracleAdaptor.sol) Example Chainlink-compatible price feed
