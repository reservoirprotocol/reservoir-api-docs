# Getting Started with OpenSea on Reservoir

Reservoir offers access to OpenSea & 150+ other marketplaces through our simple, and powerful APIs, SDKs & UI kits. To get started you can [get an API key](/reference/dashboard-sign-up) which has a generous [free plan & affordable paid subscriptions](https://reservoir.tools/pricing). OpenSea orders and data are included in all of our endpoints. However, should you want to access OpenSea data and trading specifically, you can. The following sections outline how to access OpenSea data and trading using Reservoir.

# Getting OpenSea Data & Orders

* **Sales** - Get OpenSea Sales from our [Sales API](/reference/getsalesv5). Filtering using the API is not currently supported, so get all sales for a token, collection, or attribute, and filter on the front end using `"orderSource": "opensea.io"`or `"fillSource": "opensea.io"`. When using `orderSource` you are filtering by sales whose orders are native to OpenSea, while filtering on `fillSource` will return all sales that were filled on OpenSea, regardless of the order origination marketplace.

* **Asks (Listings)** - OpenSea asks (listings) can be accessed through our [Asks API.](/reference/getordersasksv4) To get OpenSea listings, ensure to set the `source=opensea.io`. [An example of the response.](https://api.reservoir.tools/orders/asks/v4?source=opensea.io)

* **Bids (Offers)** - OpenSea bids (offers) can be accessed through our [Bids API.](/reference/getordersbidsv5) To get OpenSea Offers, ensure to set the `source=opensea.io`. [An example of the response.](https://api.reservoir.tools/orders/bids/v5?source=opensea.io)
