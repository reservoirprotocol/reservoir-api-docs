Reservoir offers access to Flow & a number of EVM-compatible chains through our simple, yet powerful APIs, SDKs & UI kits for NFT trading and data. To get started [create an account](https://dashboard.reservoir.tools/) and [get an API key](/reference/dashboard-sign-up).

* **Flow API Base URL** - You can access all Reservoir APIs by using the `https://api-flow.reservoir.tools` base URL. When using the API reference docs for Flow, make sure to change the base URL to the one above.
* **Recommended Test Collection** - Our recommended Flow NFT collection to test with is [Reservoir ERC721 Test Collection](https://evm.flowscan.io/token/0x9484a31f51108f095fcd7aa2bb8d22340d20c422?a=0) contract address: `0x9484a31f51108f095fcd7aa2bb8d22340d20c422 `.
