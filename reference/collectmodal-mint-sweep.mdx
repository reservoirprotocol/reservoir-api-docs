CollectModal provides a simple method to mint or sweep the collection based on its current state.

***

# Prerequisites ⚙️

[Install and configure ReservoirKit](/reference/installing-reservoirkit).

# CollectModal Setup

ReservoirKit provides a simple to configure modal for adding both minting and sweeping to your react app. Below is an example of a simple CollectModal setup.

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript typescript
  import { CollectModal } from '@reservoir0x/reservoir-kit-ui'

  <CollectModal
    trigger={
        <button>
        	Collect
        </button>
      }
    collectionId="0xf5de760f2e916647fd766b4ad9e85ff943ce3a2b"
    mode="preferMint"
    onCollectComplete={(data) => {
      console.log('Collect Complete', data)
    }}
    onCollectError={(error, data) => {
      console.log('Collect Error', error, data)
    }}
    onClose={(data, currentStep) => {
      console.log('CollectModal Closed')
    }}
  />
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Let's dive into the parameters:

| **Prop**               | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Required |

| **collectionId**       | The collection id of the collection you wish to mint/sweep. Can be undefined until the data is ready.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Y        |
| **onConnectWallet**    | A function that beings the connect wallet flow. Use this to prompt your connect modal and continue the ux of connecting the user's wallet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Y        |
| **tokenId**            | The token id of the token you wish to mint/sweep. Can be undefined until the data is ready.**Note**: You should only pass in a tokenId for ERC1155 collections where you want to mint/sweep a specific token.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | N        |
| **mode**               | There are three possible modes for the CollectModal: `preferMint`: If minting is available, will use the mint mode. Otherwise, will sweep the cheapest tokens from secondary`mint`: Will only allow minting`trade`: Will only allow sweeping from secondary The default behavior is `preferMint`                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | N        |
| **openState**          | This is a state tuple from react's [useState](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html), you can use this to programmatically open or close the modal. The modal will use this state when determining if the modal is open or closed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | N        |
| **copyOverrides**      | An object containing copy overrides for titles and ctas contained in the modal. Refer to the `ModalCopy` [type](https://github.com/reservoirprotocol/reservoir-kit/blob/main/packages/ui/src/modal/collect/CollectModal.tsx#L22) for which tokens map to what copy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | N        |
| **feesOnTopBps**       | Used to conditionally apply a referral fee on top of an order when purchasing. The parameter is an array of strings with the referrer and the fee separated by a colon: `['0xabc:250']`. The fee is in bps. The fee currency will follow the default rules for the execute buy endpoint `feesOnTop` parameter. This takes precedence over the `feesOnTopFixed`.                                                                                                                                                           | N        |
| **feesOnTopUsd**       | Used to conditionally apply a referral fee on top of an order when purchasing. The parameter is an array of strings with the referrer and the fee separated by a colon: `['0xabc:1000000']`. The fee is a flat fee in the atomic unit of usd (6 decimals). It will then be converted to the purchase currency to match the same value in USD. So for example if you have 1000000 configured (1 usd) and the total price is in ETH the fee applied will be \~0.00054 ETH (or whatever is equivalent to 1 usd in realtime). | N        |
| **normalizeRoyalties** | Use this to ensure that royalties are added to the order. If royalties are missing from the order then the correct royalties are added on top. If unspecified then the [global setting](/reference/installing-reservoirkit#configuring-reservoirkit-ui) will be used if provided.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | N        |
| **chainId**            | The chain id to force the modal to render, ensure that this is a chain that is configured in the ReservoirKit provider. If not specified then the active chain configured in the ReservoirKitProvider will be used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | N        |

## Custom CollectModal

The CollectModal also comes with a custom renderer which can be used to just get the data layer that the CollectModal uses internally to handle the underlying business logic. With the renderer you can rebuild the UI completely to your liking. Below is an example of how it works in practice.

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript typescript
  import { CollectModal, CollectStep } from '@reservoir0x/reservoir-kit-ui'

  <CollectModal.Custom
    open={open}
    collectionId={collectionId}>
    {({
  		contentMode,
      collection,
      token,
      loading,
      address,
      selectedTokens,
      setSelectedTokens,
      itemAmount,
      setItemAmount,
      maxItemAmount,
      setMaxItemAmount,
      paymentCurrency,
      setPaymentCurrency,
      chainCurrency,
      paymentTokens,
      total,
      totalIncludingFees,
      feeOnTop,
      feeUsd,
      usdPrice,
      usdPriceRaw,
      isConnected,
      currentChain,
      mintPrice,
      orders,
      balance,
      contract,
      hasEnoughCurrency,
      addFundsLink,
      blockExplorerBaseUrl,
      transactionError,
      stepData,
      setStepData,
      collectStep,
      setCollectStep,
      collectTokens,
    }) => {
      { Your Custom React Elements }
    })}
  </CollectModal.Custom>
  ```
</CodeGroup>

The custom CollectModal takes a few parameters like before with one additional one being the `open` parameter. This is because there is no trigger, you have control over what sort of modal you want this to eventually live in and how to trigger that modal. You'll have the ability to add a custom button with a custom handler, etc. The custom CollectModal then passes some key data into the children which we parse above and use in our custom UI. It's also important to note the `CollectStep` here which is used to manage the internal state of the CollectModal's logic. You can decide to use all or some of the data passed into your custom implementation.
