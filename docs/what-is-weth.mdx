title: "What is WETH?"

---

Wrapped Ethereum (WETH) is Ethereum wrapped in the ERC-20 standard. This ERC-20 standard allows you to approve the token to be transferred, which is the fundamental mechanism by which you can place bids and have the WETH transferred out of your wallet at a later date. This is also why you need to approve your WETH for trading.
