The Reservoir Indexer is responsible for reading from and writing to the [Data Lake](/docs/data-lake) and reconstructing the [Global NFT Orderbook](/docs/global-nft-orderbook). The Indexer combines raw order data from Arweave, with ownership data from Ethereum, to trustlessly reconstruct the state of the orderbook and provides open [APIs](/reference/getting-started) for interacting with the data.
