title: "Can I get Blur listings and bids?"
---

Yes, Reservoir aggregates Blur listings and bids. Blur listings are returned alongside other supported marketplace listings in our [tokens](/reference/gettokensv6) and [orders](/reference/getordersasksv5) endpoints.

We are working on adding the ability to purchase Blur items in loan escrow (e.g. Blend).

<Warning>
  To create and fill Blur orders there are some known limitations. [Learn more](/reference/blur-api)
