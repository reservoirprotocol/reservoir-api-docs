title: "Why are the number of listings different?"

---

The number of listing from a collection might differ from OpenSea to Reservoir to Blur. This is because Reservoir aggregates all orders, so we typically have a higher number of orders than OpenSea or X2Y2 for a collection. You might see the number between Reservoir and Blur to be a little different; this can happen because we do not have listings before we started aggregating Blur in April 2023.
