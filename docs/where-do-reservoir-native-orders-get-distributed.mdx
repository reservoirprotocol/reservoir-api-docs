title: "Where do Reservoir native orders get distributed?"

---

Reservoir native orders get instantly distributed to any marketplaces that get built on top of Reservoir's developer products and [OpenSea Pro](https://pro.opensea.io/).

While native orders are not automatically posted into OpenSea, our router makes it easy to execute that within our APIs, SDKs, etc.

Read more about cross-posting orders (e.g. OpenSea) [here](/docs/bulk-order-creation).
