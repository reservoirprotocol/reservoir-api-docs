title: "Flagged Token Status"
description: "Track and exclude NFTs that are flagged on OpenSea from Reservoir endpoints"
---

Reservoir offers a range of APIs to help developers to track and exclude NFTs that are flagged on OpenSea:

* View the "non-flagged" collection floor price ([on-demand](/reference/getcollectionsv5) or [historical](/reference/geteventscollectionsflooraskv1))
* [Show a list of Tokens](/reference/gettokensv6), with flagged tokens filtered or indicated
* [Fetch all Token IDs](/reference/gettokensidsv1) in a collection that are flagged
* Exclude flagged tokens when [placing collection offers](/reference/postexecutebidv4)
* [View changes in flag status](/reference/gettokensflagchangesv1), to keep your own DB in sync
* [Oracle for excluding flagged tokens](/reference/getoracletokensstatusv2) in on-chain applications

### Relevant Fields

* `isFlagged` = whether or not the token is flagged (0 or 1)
* `lastFlagChange` = date that the flag status last changed
* `lastFlagUpdate` = date that the flag status was last checked

### Freshness

We strive to have the freshest possible data using the following methods:

* Automated re-checks popular collections and floor tokens
* Crowd-sourced re-checks from users of the Reservoir SDK, as they view tokens

That said, there is always a risk of us not being perfectly in sync. If you only need data for a single token, it is always safer to check OpenSea directly. In fact, there is a method in the Reservoir SDK that makes this easy to add to your app, and report back to our API if it notices a discrepancy, crowd-sourcing better results for everyone.

### Non-Tradeable Tokens

The strict definition of a "flagged" token is that it is "not tradeable on OpenSea". Unfortunately, there are other reasons that a token might not be tradeable, other than being reported stolen, and it's not possible to differentiate these. For example:

* NFTs that pre-date ERC-721 (e.g. CryptoPunks)
* Tokens that can be staked without lockup (e.g. Moonbirds & The Potatoez & DeGods)

For these collections, all tokens or a large number of tokens will be marked as "flagged". We are actively working on a potential solution, but don't have one yet.
