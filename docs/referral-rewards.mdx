Many Protocols include referral rewards or bounties as part of their orders to share some of fees with fillers and other applications building on top. ​ An example of this is Zora’s protocol rewards which gives referrers a portion of their 0.000777 ETH mint fee. ​ [https://twitter.com/ourZORA/status/1687146881791791104?s=20](https://twitter.com/ourZORA/status/1687146881791791104?s=20) ​ There are a few different places in the Reservoir Platform where you can add a referrer. It’s as easy as passing an address and we’ll figure out how to get you rewards depending on the protocol you’re interacting with! ​ The most basic place to add a referrer is via our SDK ​
