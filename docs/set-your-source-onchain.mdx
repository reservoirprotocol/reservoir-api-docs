title: "Set Your Source Onchain"

---

Onchain attribution provides the solution for precise on-chain transaction attribution when orders are fulfilled through common exchange contracts. This allows apps to showcase their volume and sales on-chain through tools like Dune. This doc will help you utilize onchain attribution. To read more behind this concept, check out [Marketplace Source Attribution](/docs/calldata-attribution).

Reservoir allows you to attribute sales, listings, and bids to your source whether that is a marketplace, wallet, or app. The method you choose to interact with Reservoir determines how to set your source. Reference the guides below to set your source properly.

With your source is set properly, you will have orders and transactions attributed to your platform. Learn more about our source attribution methods [here](/docs/calldata-attribution)

# Reservoir SDK

After installing, you will set your source when you configure the Reservoir SDK. The source parameter can be any valid domain (e.g. explorer.reservoir.tools). You can reference the [full documentation](/reference/reservoir-sdk-jstsnode) if you want to adjust other parameters. Below is a simple example below showing where you set your source; in this case, the source is `yoursource.com`. If you leave this blank, these orders will have source set to null.

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript typescript
  import { createClient, reservoirChains } from "@reservoir0x/reservoir-sdk"

  createClient({
    chains: [{
      ...reservoirChains.mainnet,
      active: true,
    }],
    source: "yoursource.com" //You can replace this with your domain
  });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

# ReservoirKit

After installing, you can set your source when you configure the ReservoirKit. Check out the [full documentation](/reference/installing-reservoirkit) if you want to see all possible params. Below is a simple example below showing where you set your source. The source is `yoursource.com`. If you leave this blank, these orders will have source set to null.

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript typescript
  import { reservoirChains } from '@reservoir0x/reservoir-sdk'
  import {
    ReservoirKitProvider,
    darkTheme,
  } from '@reservoir0x/reservoir-kit-ui'
  import { WagmiConfig } from 'wagmi'

  const wagmiClient = ...

  const theme = darkTheme({
    headlineFont: "Sans Serif",
    font: "Serif",
    primaryColor: "#323aa8",
    primaryHoverColor: "#252ea5",
  })

  <ReservoirKitProvider
    options={{
      apiKey: "YOUR_KEY",
      chains: [{
        ...reservoirChains.mainnet,
        active: true,
      }],
      source: "yoursource.com" //Set your source here!
      ...
    }}
    theme={theme}
  >
    <WagmiConfig client={wagmiClient}>

     { Your App }

    </WagmiConfig>
  </ReservoirKitProvider>
  ```

# Reservoir API

<Warning>
  [Reservoir SDK](#reservoir-sdk) includes helpers that abstract the process of iterating through steps, and returning callbacks that can be used to update your UI.
</Warning>

When you utilize our APIs for executing your transactions, you will set the source in your API call. This example has the source as `yoursource.com`. If left blank, your source will default to `null`.
