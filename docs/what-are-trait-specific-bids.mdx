title: "What are trait-specific bids?"

---

Trait-specific bids are bids that apply to any token that has a particular trait associated with it.

A single trait-specific bid can be accepted by any holder of a token with the trait. Once your single trait-specific bid is accepted, it is considered executed. Only one sale is possible with each bid quantity, even if the bid applies to multiple tokens.

Further, we allow you to create custom sets of tokens on which to bid, in a similar style to how trait-specific bids work (see the token set API [here](/reference/posttokensetsv2)).
