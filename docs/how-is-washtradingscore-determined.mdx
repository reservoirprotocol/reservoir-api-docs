title: "How the washTradingScore is determined"
---

The `washTradingScore` is a metric used to determine the likelihood of wash trading activity for a particular transaction. Wash trading refers to the practice of artificially inflating trading volume by simultaneously buying and selling the same asset.

In the Reservoir Indexer, the `washTradingScore` is calculated by checking wallets that trade back and forth. We also manual blocklist collections and wallets with high wash trading. Treat the score as a rough estimation. The score returned will be either 0 or 1.

Please note a `washTradingScore` of 1 does not guarantee wash trading occurred, but the transaction exhibits a high likelihood of wash trading. It serves as an indicator to flag potentially suspicious trading activity for further analysis.
