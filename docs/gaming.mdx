Reservoir provides feature-rich NFT marketplace infrastructure, enabling game developers and platforms to build custom NFT marketplaces and seamlessly add buying, selling, and minting directly into games.

# Leveraging Reservoir in Web3 Games

* **NFT Trade Execution** - Source and fill aggregated NFT listings & bids from [major marketplaces](/reference/supported-marketplaces) across [EVM chains](/reference/supported-chains).
* **Hosted Orderbook** - Create your own NFT orderbook with full functionality without having to worry about routing or gas optimization. Use the exchange of your choice, including Seaport or Payment Processor.
* **Custom Fees** - Add custom fees into orders and add fees on top of any aggregated listings or bids.
* **Custom Chain Indexing** - Use Reservoir on your appchain, ensuring flexibility and scalability tailored to your game's needs.
* **NFT Minting** - Let users [mint](/docs/minting) directly out of your gaming marketplace or in-game experience.
* **Royalty Enforcement** - Normalize royalties on any order or leverage ERC721C and payment processor to build royalty enforcement into your contracts.

# In Game Buying & Selling

Reservoir allows games to add NFT marketplace functionality directly into game experiences. Build an in-game marketplace, onboard your users directly in your app, or add trading into gameplay without having to link out to external marketplaces.

## Browser Based Experiences

For games that are building an in-browser experience, our suggestion is to utilize our [SDK ](/reference/reservoir-sdk-jstsnode)or [ReservoirKit (React)](/reference/reservoirkit) tools. Leveraging these will allow for a seamless trading experience.

## Unity and Unreal Engine Games

For those who are building games with [Unity ](https://unity.com/)or [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US), currently we suggest to use our [hosted APIs](/reference/overview) to build with Reservoir. If you are building through Unity or Unreal Engine, and are looking for Reservoir binding support for those engines, please reach out.

# Custom Gaming Marketplaces

Build a custom marketplace for your game to allow users to buy and sell assets without leaving the game experience.

## Using Reservoir Tools

Developers can start building with Reservoir through many different layers. To effectively leverage Reservoir to build a custom marketplace, we recommend you use either:

* [Reservoir SDK (JS/TS/Node)](/reference/reservoir-sdk-jstsnode): An abstracted SDK for interacting with the NFT market. All the function of the Reservoir API wrapped into easily-to-use, performant methods.
* [ReservoirKit (React)](/reference/reservoirkit): a react library that makes it easy to add marketplace functionality and UI into your project. ReservoirKit is a react library that wraps the Reservoir SDK, so its less of a choice between these two and more a choice of whether you would like to use UI kit components in your application.
