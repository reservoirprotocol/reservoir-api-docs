title: "Add feesOnTop to Orders"
---

`feesOnTop` (referral fees) are fees paid to an individual or entity for facilitating a sale. For example, you can set `feesOnTop` on your marketplace built with Reservoir's SDK, ReservoirKit, or APIs for all orders purchased on your platform. This applies to orders coming from OpenSea or other aggregated marketplaces.

### Using the Reservoir SDK

To add `feesOnTop`, you can follow these steps for the [`buyToken` method](/reference/buytoken):

1. First, make sure you have installed and configured the Reservoir SDK. If you haven't, you can refer to the Reservoir SDK (JS/TS/Node) [here](/reference/reservoir-sdk-jstsnode).

2. Next, when executing a buy or sell order, you can include the `feesOnTop` in the options (formatted as `feeRecipient:feeAmount`). The `feesOnTop` parameter is an array of objects, each containing a recipient (the address receiving the referral fee) and a fixed fee in wei.

Here's a sample code snippet for adding `feesOnTop` when buying a token:

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript typescript
  import { getClient, Execute } from "@reservoir0x/reservoir-sdk";
  import { createWalletClient, http } from 'viem'

  ...

  address = "0x8ba1f109551bD432803012645Ac136ddd6000000"
  signer = createWalletClient({
    account: address,
    transport: http()
  })

  getClient()?.actions.buyToken({
    items: [{ token: "0xbc4ca0eda7647a8ab7c2061c2e118a18a936f13d:1", quantity: 1 }],
    options: {
      feesOnTop: [
        "0xF296178d553C8Ec21A2fBD2c5dDa8CA9ac905A00:1000000000000000", 
        "0xF296178d553C8Ec21A2fBD2c5dDa8CA9ac905A00:1000000000000000"
      ]
    }
    signer,
    onProgress: (steps: Execute['steps']) => {
      console.log(steps)
    }
  })
  ```
</CodeGroup>

This example demonstrates how to add feesOnTop when buying a token using the Reservoir SDK. The `feesOnTop` parameter is included in the options object when calling the `buyToken` method.

### Using the ReservoirKit

You can add `feesOnTopBps` or `feesOnTopFixed` in ReservoirKit. This is for the [BuyModal](/reference/buymodal). Please note that `feesOnTopBps` will take precedence over the `feesOnTopFixed`. The `feesOnTopFixed` is in the atomic unit of the listing currency (e.g. wei is used for ETH). List of fees (formatted as `feeRecipient:feeAmount`) to be taken when filling. Unless overridden via the currency param, the currency used for any fees on top matches the buy-in currency detected by the backend.

Below is a sample configuration for the [BuyModal](/docs/buymodal). Note that an array of referrers and fees cannot be passed, please see the [SDK](###using-the-reservoir-sdk) or [API](###using-the-execute-api) to pass an array.

<CodeGroup>
  ```typescript typescript
  import { BuyModal } from '@reservoir0x/reservoir-kit-ui'

  <BuyModal
    trigger={
      <button>
        Buy Token
      </button>
    }
    collectionId="0xf5de760f2e916647fd766b4ad9e85ff943ce3a2b"
    tokenId="1236715"
  	feesOnTopBps={['0xF296178d553C8Ec21A2fBD2c5dDa8CA9ac905A00:250']}
    onPurchaseComplete={(data) => console.log('Purchase Complete')}
    onPurchaseError={(error, data) => console.log('Transaction Error', error, data)}
    onClose={(data, stepData, currentStep) => console.log('Modal Closed')}

  />
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Using the Reservoir API

<Warning>
  [Reservoir SDK](#using-reservoir-sdk) includes helpers that abstract the process of iterating through steps, and returning callbacks that can be used to update your UI.
</Warning>

To set a `feesOnTop` for an order, input in the `feesOnTop` field (formatted as `feeRecipient:feeBps`) as an option for the [`/execute/buy` API](/reference/postexecutebuyv7). In the example, the `feesOnTop` parameter is an array of objects, each containing a recipient (the address receiving the referral fee) and a fixed fee in wei.
